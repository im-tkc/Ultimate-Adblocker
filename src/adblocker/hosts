# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THIS FILE YOU HAVE TO RESTART THE ACRYLIC DNS  #
# PROXY SERVICE IN ORDER TO SEE THEIR EFFECTS.                              #
#                                                                           #
# This is the AcrylicHosts.txt file.                                        #
#                                                                           #
# It contains predefined mappings between names and addresses exactly the   #
# same way the native HOSTS file does.                                      #
#                                                                           #
# The format is: IPADDRESS HOSTNAME1 [HOSTNAME2] [HOSTNAME3] ...            #
#                                                                           #
# Where IPADDRESS is in quad-dotted notation and HOSTNAMES are strings.     #
#                                                                           #
# The separator between IPADDRESS and HOSTNAMES can be any number of spaces #
# or tabs or both. If the HOSTNAMES contain the special characters '*' and  #
# '?' a (slow) "dir" like pattern matching algorithm is used instead of a   #
# (fast) binary search within the list of host names:                       #
#                                                                           #
# 127.0.0.1 ad.* ads.*                                                      #
#                                                                           #
# If a HOSTNAME starts with the '/' character instead it is treated like a  #
# regular expression (also very slow compared to a binary search):          #
#                                                                           #
# 127.0.0.1 /^ads?\..*$                                                     #
#                                                                           #
# Note: More info about the regular expression engine and its syntax can be #
# found at: http://regexpstudio.com                                         #
#                                                                           #
# It is also possible to specify exceptions when regular expressions or     #
# pattern based matching is used. If for example we would like to filter    #
# out all ads.* like domains except for the ads.test1 and the ads.test2 we  #
# should write:                                                             #
#                                                                           #
# 127.0.0.1 ads.* -ads.test1 -ads.test2                                     #
#                                                                           #
# Note: A line starting with the '#' character (and everything after it if  #
# it's found within a line) is considered a comment and therefore ignored.  #
#                                                                           #
